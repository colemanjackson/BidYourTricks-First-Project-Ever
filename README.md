GitRepo
=======

My first Git repo ever, along with my first real Java program I did with no prompt in about an hour of work. This really marks the beginning of my work as a programmer. The program is a game tracker for a family game we play known as Bid your Tricks. I won't go into any further detail, its a pretty pointless game tracker, but it's there to review.
